In this project, we have developed an Automatic Answering System on Pantip. By using question information from the Pantip website (Pantip.com) in this project, natural language processing techniques have been used such as tokenize, Word embedding, clustering, etc. We construct a Q&amp;A system using Dialogflow, a Google platform for chatbots, as the engine. We also develop a website to demonstrate our system. We conducted experiments to assess system performance using various methods for grouping questions. The results of the study show that the hierarchical cluster method can provide higher accuracy in answering the questions.
